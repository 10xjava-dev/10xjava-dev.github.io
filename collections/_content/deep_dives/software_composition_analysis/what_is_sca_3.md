## SCA Feature Set

#### Core requirements

**Dependency Tracking**
1. Automatic detection of external libraries and dependencies
2. Gather version information for each component
3. Provide insight into the list of external elements required for application build, deployment, and execution

**Security Vulnerability Identification**
1. Reporting of known security issues within each component
2. Connection to public databases of reported vulnerabilities
3. Real-time alerts and notifications for newly discovered vulnerabilities

#### Additional Features

**License Compliance**
1. Scanning for dependencies and discovering their version information
2. Reporting on software licenses used by components
3. Identification of declared licenses in source code
4. Ensuring legal compliance and avoiding intellectual property issues

**Quality Assessment**
1. Comparison of discovered components against data covering software quality
2. Assessment of API breakage
3. Evaluation of external compliance standards

#### Advanced Features ####

**Integration and Automation**
1. Integration with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline integration
3. Automation of scans at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**Policy Management**
1. Customizable policies for handling discovered vulnerabilities and compliance issues
2. Automated enforcement of policies during development and deployment
3. Management of organizational policies through various SDLC stages

**Detailed Reporting and Analytics**
1. Comprehensive reports on security, compliance, and quality metrics
2. Dashboards for real-time monitoring and analytics
3. Historical data analysis and trend visualization

**Remediation Guidance**
1. Suggested fixes and mitigation strategies for identified issues
2. Integration with issue tracking systems for streamlined remediation
3. Prioritization of issues based on severity and impact

**Collaboration and Communication**
1. Tools for team collaboration and communication
2. Sharing of reports and findings with stakeholders
3. Integration with communication platforms for alerts and updates

**Support for wide range of Languages and Platforms**
1. Compatibility with multiple programming languages
2. Support for different operating systems and platforms
3. Ability to scan binary and source code

### Additional Considerations ###
**Scalability**
1. Ability to handle large projects and multiple dependencies
2. Efficient performance with minimal impact on development workflows

**Customization and Flexibility**
1. Configurable scan parameters and policies
2. Support for custom rules and checks
