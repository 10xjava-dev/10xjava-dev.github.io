intro: SCA tools help developers manage and secure their applications by analyzing the components and libraries they integrate into their software. 
takeaway: This section provides an overview of SCA, discussing its importance, the different levels of analysis available, and the specific problems it helps identify and resolve. By understanding and implementing SCA correctly, developers can enhance their projects' security, compliance, and maintainability.

## What is Software Composition Analysis?
  
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a toolset that helps software development teams manage the open-source and third-party components they use in their applications. At its core, SCA provides insights into the componentsâ€™ security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance, and overall health.

### Components of SCA

There are two core elements to SCA  that any tool should be able to perform. A further two capabilities are strictly optional but provide increasing value. 

 1)  **Dependency Tracking**

SCA tools should automatically detect all external libraries and dependencies a project uses and provide insight into the version information of each component. This is the core capability of a SCA tool: to be able to analyse the application code and detect the list of external elements required for the application to be built, deployed and executed.  

2)  **Security Vulnerability Identification:**

SCA tools must use the discovered dependency information to report on known security issues within each component. Given the dependency list above it is reasonable to be able to connect that list to public databases of reported vulnerabilities.  

3)  **License Compliance:**

The process of scanning for dependencies and discovering the version information for them provides opportunities to report on the Software Licenses being used by those components. Additionally, the SCA tool may look at the application or dependency source code to determine if there are declared licences present. The ability to scan and identify the licenses of all used components is a key SCA capability for those who need to ensure legal compliance and avoid potential intellectual property issues.

4) **Quality Assessment:**

Similar to the licence discovery process it's feasibble for the SCA tool to compare the discoveed components agains other data that covers software quality, API breakage, external compliance etc.

## How SCA fits into your software supply chain

The concept of SCA is reasonably straightforward.  Analyse the application (binaries / source or both) to discover the component makeup and then use that data to highlight vulnerabilities and other relevent information.

The next question concerns what to do with the information.  A moments thought will revel that there are two elements to consider: <i>When</i> do you need to discover this information and <i>how</i> do you react?
Assuming that the SCA tools you use can be run at any stage during the Software Developement LifeCycle (SDLC) then ideally the first time will be as early as possible. Ideally during coding - maybe even in the IDE. It would be perfect if during development the developer could be informed that
the selection of a new dependency would introduce issues.

That bring us to the 'what' element. How do you deal with the discovery? What policy should be in place to guide the right thing to do? It might seem straightforward to simply prevent the introduction of a new, unacceptable component and it often is. Unfortuantly that's likely the simplest, easier case to consider.
What do you do when, during development, the SCA tool informs the developer that an existing dependency now has an issue? Should you force an upgrade?  What if the newer version of the dependency also has problems?

As you can see, dealing with the discovery of a issue is hardly ever simple. Let's expand on that and explore a few aspects.

Finding issues at development time is just one place in the SDLC that the SCA tools need to be run. Often we tranform the code we're writing by various means: from simply compiling the code to packaging, adding in a container , even deploying to cloud. At each step in the process you must evaluate if the application has been transformed , added to, or removed from. A problemetatic dependency discoveed at development time might have disappeared at packaging because the code concerned isn't included.
Conversely during packaging into, say a zip, other code might be added. At which point you need SCA tools to evaluate the result.

Every step of the SLDC has to be evauluated for the need to run an SCA. If you're wondering why you dont just go straight to the end result and scan that, there are good reasons.

1. Detecting a problem as early as possible usually reduces cost.
2. There are almost always issues in the dependencies of some kind so the chance of a clean run is unlikely - there will be humans involved in the final assessment.
3. Issues can be found in any dependency - including the build tools , base images etc. Therefore SCA tools have to be used appropriatelty at every stage.

Looking at SCA as a type of quality gate can help with understanding the need to run the analysis at various points during the SDLC. It can also help with understandng that the policy use use to inhibit / resolve issues will be different depending on the SDLC stage: You'll want your developers to be able to use newer compo
to be able to assess their value and/or keep up todate with latest APIs. You might let that dependency through several stages but never let it get into production. However if that dependency has a new licence you might close the doors early and have a policy that makes it unavailable to developers.

**To sum up:**  Run SCA tools at each step of the SDLC to provide the broadest coverage and accept that you'll need to provide mechanisms to manage your organisational policies through out.


## Exploring the (devil in the) details

The details above cover theoretical SCA tools.  In reality the capabilities of available tools is wide ranging.
There is no silver bullet single solution but we can explore the requiements of such a tool.
