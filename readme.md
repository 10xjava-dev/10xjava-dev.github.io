This website is built off Jekyll https://jekyllrb.com/

To build you need to follow here https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

eventually you can run "bundle exec jekyll serve" and the website will appear.

Almost all of the content changes you make should be automatically updated when your refresh the browser.

To add authors or book pages look into the data directory and copy one of the pages there.

Author Photos should go into the assets/images/pics folder (try to do so as a png format)

Book pages have a sequence number to order them in the main view

Use "/authors" for a list if authors   "/book" for book outline.

Every page should have its own permalink generated so you can share direct links
