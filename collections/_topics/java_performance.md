{% section 10x %}
Understanding about performance requires you to learn more about how computers actually work. Having that mental model will allow you to reason about systems design more accurately and hence allows you to make a bigger impact on your team and organisation.  Performance is all about clarity of thinking, following evidence without predijuce and understanding at each step what is the next most optimal action. It also you requires you to be able to communicate your findings in a compelling, unbiased and acurate manner. All of these aspects are strong elements in any 10x developer.
