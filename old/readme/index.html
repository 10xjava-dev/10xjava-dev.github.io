<p>This website is built off Jekyll https://jekyllrb.com/</p>

<p>To build you need to follow here https://jekyllrb.com/docs/</p>

<p>eventually you can run “bundle exec jekyll serve” and the website will appear.</p>

<p>Almost all of the content changes you make should be automatically updated when your refresh the browser.</p>

<p>To add authors or book pages look into the data directory and copy one of the pages there.</p>

<p>Author Photos should go into the assets/images/pics folder (try to do so as a png format)</p>

<p>Book pages have a sequence number to order them in the main view</p>

<p>Use “/authors” for a list if authors   “/book” for book outline.</p>

<p>Every page should have its own permalink generated so you can share direct links</p>
